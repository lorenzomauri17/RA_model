## Simulation of a Representative Agent model

Simulation of the evolution of the system and analysis of the steady state.
Effects on the economy of different fiscal regimes are studied.

The Representative agent solves the following maximization problem
```math
\max\below{\left(c_t,h_t\right)_1^\infty}\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}U\left(c_t-G(h_t)\right)
```


To simulate the model run `main.m`
